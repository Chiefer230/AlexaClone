# AlexaClone
This AlexaClone expressing and showcasing the possibilites of Python Libraries in conjunction with one another.
For this Project, I am using Speech Recoginition to parse Voice data to String Data and Pyttsx3 to parse String Data to Voice Data. The Speech Recognition is primarily used for the Bots input data where it will recognize specific phrases and use Pyttsx3 to generate output for the user to hear based on each phrase.

Data-
  Each Phrase for Now is HardCoded with expected strings to look for and outputs limited responses through speech
  Hopefully, we can implement a database(SQL or Excel) of expected phrases and their repsonses to make the Bot less stoic



Mobility-
  The Program for now is hosted on a desktop where it does not have access to the internet which restricts it to it's local stored data. There is an effort of trying to make this program versatile by allowing it to be hosted on a smartwatch, Glasses or even a Mobile device with access to the internet. This can allow the Program to grab real time data and have more versatility in what it is capable of.
